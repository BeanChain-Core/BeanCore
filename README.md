# BeanCore

**BeanCore** is the official SDK for the BeanChain blockchain network. It provides core transaction models, cryptographic utilities, wallet state structures, and reusable tools shared across all BeanChain projects â€” including nodes, wallets, contract runners, and developer tools.

This SDK is designed for modular integration with:
- *Java Built BeanChain Applications*
- BeanNode (validator node)
- Contract Execution Node (CEN)
- Reward Node (RN)
- Indexers and future sidechain modules

## What's Included

This package currently includes the following classes and modules:

### Block
- `Block.java`: Core block structure and Merkle logic

### ~CENCALL (Contract Execution Call Logic)~ *WIP THESE COMPONENTS ARE NOT USABLE IN CURRENT STATE*
- ~`CallManager.java`: General contract call processor~
- ~`stakeCallManager.java`: Manages staking contract interactions~

### Crypto
- `SHA256TransactionSigner.java`: Signs SHA-256 hashes using ECDSA over secp256k1
- `TransactionVerifier.java`: Verifies wallet signature and transaction authenticity
- `WalletGenerator.java`: Key pair generation, public key derivation, and address formatting

### Models
- ~`Layer2Wallet.java`: Stores wallet balances for Layer 2 tokens~ *WIP THIS COMPONENTS ARE NOT USABLE IN CURRENT STATE*
- `StateWallet.java`: Stores nonce and balance information for Layer 1 wallets

### Security
- `SecuritySetup.java`: Initializes Bouncy Castle cryptographic provider

### TXs (Transaction Types)
- `TX.java`: Main Layer 1 transaction structure
- ~`MintTX.java`: Specialized transaction for minting Layer 2 tokens~ *WIP THIS COMPONENTS ARE NOT USABLE IN CURRENT STATE*

### Utils
- `beantoshinomics.java`: Converts between BEAN and beantoshi (smallest unit)
- `hex.java`: Hex encoding/decoding utility

### Wizard
- `wizard.java`: Utility placeholder for future developer scaffolding *USED AS LIGHT ENCRYPTION FOR NODE CONFIG, WILL BE UPDATED, AND WILL BE USED TO CREATE AN EASY DOWNLOAD LOCAL WIZARD KEY SAVER*
